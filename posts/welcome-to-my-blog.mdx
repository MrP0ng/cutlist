# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post written in **MDX**! MDX is an amazing format that allows you to use JSX components directly in your Markdown content.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, export metadata, and write JSX expressions within your markdown content.

### Features of This Blog

- âœ… **Dynamic routing** with `/post/[slug]`
- âœ… **Frontmatter support** for metadata
- âœ… **Dark mode** compatibility
- âœ… **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS
- âœ… **TypeScript** for type safety
- âœ… **SEO optimized** with proper meta tags

## Code Examples

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

And here's some TypeScript:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com"
};
```

## Lists and More

Here are some things I love about this setup:

1. **Easy to write** - Just write Markdown!
2. **Component support** - Use React components when needed
3. **Fast performance** - Static generation with Next.js
4. **Great developer experience** - TypeScript and modern tooling
